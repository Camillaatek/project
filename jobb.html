        <h2><mark>My dream job</mark></h2>
        <p>A few years ago I discovered something called "freelancer" and immediately knew it was something i wanted to go for. My dreamjob would be whatever i can do as a freelancer while living on a sailboat in places such as greece, bora bora, maldives etc. Frontend development at Noroff was a perfect fit to fulfill my dream!</p>
